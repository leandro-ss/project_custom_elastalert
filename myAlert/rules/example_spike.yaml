# Alert when there is a sudden spike in the volume of events
# (Required)
# Rule name, must be unique
name: example_spike

# (Required)
# Type of alert.
# the spike rule type compares the number of events within two sliding windows to each other
type: spike

# (Required)
# Index to search, wildcard supported
index: metricbeat-*

# (Required one of _cur or _ref, spike specific)
# The minimum number of events that will trigger an alert
# For example, if there are only 2 events between 12:00 and 2:00, and 20 between 2:00 and 4:00
# _cur is 2 and _ref is 20, and the alert WILL fire because 20 is greater than threshold_cur
threshold_cur: 5
#threshold_ref: 5

# (Required, spike specific)
# The size of the window used to determine average event frequency
# We use two sliding windows each of size timeframe
# To measure the 'reference' rate and the current rate
timeframe:
  hours: 2

# (Required, spike specific)
# The spike rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times more
# events than the reference window
spike_height: 3

# (Required, spike specific)
# The direction of the spike
# 'up' matches only spikes, 'down' matches only troughs
# 'both' matches both spikes and troughs
spike_type: "up"

# (Required)

# These filters are joined with AND and nested in a filtered query

# (Required)
# The alert is use when a match is found
